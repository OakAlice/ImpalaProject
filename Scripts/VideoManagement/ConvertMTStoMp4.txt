To convert the MTS files to MP4.

1. Download this video management thing: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
	I donwloaded the already compiled one from here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
2. Add it to path:
	Search for “Edit the system environment variables”
	In System Properties, click Environment Variables
	Under System variables, select Path, then click Edit
	Click New, then add the path
	Change the name to be just ffmpeg and not like -7.1.1. version or anything

	However, I wasn't able to add it to path, so I just used the full thing: C:\Users\oaw001\Downloads\ffmpeg
3. Run in cmd.exe:
	cd /d D:\ImpalaProject\RawData
	for /R %f in (*.MTS) do "C:\Users\oaw001\Downloads\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe" -i "%f" -c:v copy -c:a copy "%~dpnf.mp4"
